# Advanced Routing Example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3.

These steps have been run for setting it up:

```sh
ng new angular-tour-of-heroes --minimal
ng generate universal
```

These parts have been added afterwards to demo advanced routing:
- `src/app/express-redirect-platform-location.service.ts`
- `src/app/not-found/`
